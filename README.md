# Dr Coomer
Dr Coomer was a Pygame application that I originally made about five years ago as a joke.

I've decided to port it to C# and SDL2, as a way to learn using SDL2 with C#.
# What is it?
Dr Coomer is a 'Neopet-like' application based on the character 'Dr Coomer' from the YouTube series ['Half-Life VR but the AI is self-aware'](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLglTodSj6fQGbLTtPF_YXVJ6TKSaC3O02) by [wayneradiotv](https://www.youtube.com/@wayneradiotv).

The idea originally came from a behind the scenes episode when the voice actor for Dr Coomer described the character that they were trying to portray as being like a Neopet.
# What's missing?
Since this is currently only a port of what I had made in Pygame, there are no sound effects for:
- Low hunger,
- Low Happiness.

Everything else that I currently want to be in the game is in the game.
